                    <div class="story">
                        <p>The nineties were pretty tough in Bulgaria. Most of the people, including us, were struggling
                            to make
                            ends meet. I studied in the Naval Academy in Varna and was working as an Officer in one of
                            the bases
                            on the south coast of the country. At that time Military people were making good money and
                            were treated
                            with great respect. There was only one problem - they weren't allowed to speak their minds,
                            especially
                            when it comes to politics. This is something I couldn't cope with, so I quit. That's when
                            the hardship
                            started.</p>
                        <p>There weren't many opportunities at that time in our country, so the best thing I could do
                            was to join the merchant navy. There was only one caveat - many people wanted to join so
                            It was really hard to get in. I studied for an officer but had to join as a ordinary seaman.
                            I was still happy though - my daughter was just about to be born, so we really needed the
                            money.
                        </p>
                        <p>It was that first contract with the merchant navy that helped us get off the ground and start
                            a
                            small business - a small appeal store in Varna.

                        <p>My wife always has a knack for selling things. She loves everything about it and I can
                            proudly say,
                            that she's the best saleswoman I know.
                        </p>
                        <p>Our first clothes store was located in one of the markets in the city and was rather small.
                            We didn't like the market much, there was a lot of criminal activity there, but at that
                            time this was the best we could afford. I was still doing contracts on merchant ships so
                            we can save up and open a bigger store.
                        </p>
                        <p>And so we did - we moved from the market in Varna to Golden Sands - one of the most beautiful
                            resorts on the Bulgarian coast line. This sparked our love in working with tourists.
                        </p>
                        <p>This move gave me the opportunity to stop sailing and so I did. Both my children were already
                            born, so I wanted to spend time with them. I started working as a Captain on a tug boat in
                            Varna Port - a job I still do and love.
                        </p>
                        <p>And as for the shop in Golden Sands - it grew from one store to three. And we still operate
                            them today - 20 years later.</p>

                <div class="paragraph-title">Our First Rental.</div>

                    <div class="story">
                        <p>As much as we like the work on the resort there was one problem with it. It was very tiring
                            and we weren't
                            getting any younger. Working 12 hours a day may be okay when you're thirty, but when you
                            approach 50 it gets
                            harder.
                        </p>
                        <p>It was time for a change but we first needed a plan. The problem was we didn't have one but
                            luckily we didn't have
                            to devise one either - the perfect plan found us.
                        </p>
                        <p>We had some money piled up and wanted to buy a house outside the city. We found one in the
                            beautiful village of Strashimirovo - just few kilometers away from Varna and on the coast
                            of Varna lake. The house was in a really poor condition, but the price was good. We bought
                            it
                            and repaired it. And then my wife, being the saleswoman that she is, pitched the idea of
                            renting
                            it out.
                        </p>
                        <p>To be honest I was really skeptical of that idea. People visit Varna for the buzz of the
                            city, the beaches
                            and restaurants. Who would visit to sleep in a village outside the city. But as you might
                            have already
                            guessed I was wrong.
                        </p>
                        <p>The very first summer we had got a small group of German workers staying with us for a month.
                            As it
                            turned out the place was close to the industrial area and had people visiting for both
                            pleasure and work. So people kept visiting, and they really liked it.</p>
                        <p>So there it was - out getaway. Our plan. We I said we didn't device it, it found us.</p>
